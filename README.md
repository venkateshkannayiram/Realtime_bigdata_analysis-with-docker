# Realtime_bigdata_analysis-with-docker
The project aims to develop a real-time analysis system using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. The system will collect real-time data and stream the data into Kafka. Apache Spark will then be used to process and analyze the data in real-time. The processed data will be visualized using appropriate visualizations and graphs.
