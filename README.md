# About the Project
The project aims to develop a real-time analysis system using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. The system will collect real-time data and stream the data into Kafka. Apache Spark will then be used to process and analyze the data in real-time. The processed data will be visualized using appropriate visualizations and graphs.

The system will have two main components:

* **Data Collection:** This component will collect real-time data from various sources such as IOT, SCADA, CCTV, Stock Indexes, Weather Data ...etc. The data will be cleaned and transformed into a structured format before streaming it into Kafka.
      
* **Data Processing and Visualization:** This component will process the real-time data streams using Apache Spark. Spark will perform various real-time analysis tasks such as trend analysis, stock prediction, and outlier detection. The processed data will then be visualized using interactive dashboards and graphs to provide real-time insights into the stock market trends.

The system will be scalable, allowing it to handle a large volume of data streams and perform real-time analysis.

The project will be implemented using a combination of technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker , Jupyter Notebook, and a front-end visualization tool such as Grafana. The implementation will be based on a  On-premises architecture, ensuring high availability and scalability of the system.

## What is Docker?
In simple terms, Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.

## Why use Docker?
Using Docker lets you ship code faster, standardize application operations, seamlessly move code, and save money by improving resource utilization. With Docker, you get a single object that can reliably run anywhere. Docker's simple and straightforward syntax gives you full control. Wide adoption means there's a robust ecosystem of tools and off-the-shelf applications that are ready to use with Docker.
